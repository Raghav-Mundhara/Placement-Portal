# Vite + React Project

This is a boilerplate project setup for building React applications using Vite. Vite provides a fast development environment with modern JavaScript tooling.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or later)
- npm (comes with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   Or, if you prefer Yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Or, for Yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```
   The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` by default.

4. **Build for production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   Or, with Yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```
   This will generate the production-ready files in the `dist` directory.

5. **Preview the production build:**
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```
   Or, with Yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn preview
   ```

## Example Code for Vite + React

Here’s a basic example of how the `App.jsx` file might look:

```jsx
// src/App.jsx
import React from 'react';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to Vite + React!</h1>
      <p>This is a simple React app powered by Vite.</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

And the `main.jsx` file:

```jsx
// src/main.jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App';
import './index.css';

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```
